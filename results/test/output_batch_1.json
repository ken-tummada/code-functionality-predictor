The high-level goal is to ensure any User instance contains the required fields and valid types/values before it is used or serialized. Technically it declares a class-level JSON Schema that expects an object with string properties firstName and lastName (both required) and an optional integer property age with minimum 0. The constructor stores provided values and validates the user data against the schema using the jsonschema library; validation raises jsonschema.ValidationError on invalid input. The class also provides a toJson method that returns the JSON string representation of the user. To implement this yourself: import jsonschema and json, define User.schema as described (type object, properties for firstName, lastName, age, and required list containing firstName and lastName), write __init__(self, firstName, lastName, age=None) to build a plain Python dict for the instance data (include age only when it is not None so you don't validate null against an integer type), call jsonschema.validate(data_dict, User.schema) to validate, then store the fields on the instance; implement toJson to return json.dumps(data_dict) or json.dumps(self.to_dict()) where to_dict returns the same filtered dict. Remember to install the jsonschema package (pip install jsonschema) and handle jsonschema.ValidationError if you need custom error handling."}, {"ref": "Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with each vowel capitalized and each consonant converted to its corresponding Morse code. The function should ignore any special characters or numbers in the string. The returned string should only contain alphabetic characters. The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Additionally, the function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters and convert them accordingly. The function should also handle multiple consecutive special characters or numbers in the string and ignore them completely.", "cand": "This code defines a small transformation pipeline that takes an input string and produces a single concatenated output string where vowels are preserved (converted to uppercase) and consonants are replaced by their Morse code representations; any non-alphabetic characters are ignored. Technically, it provides an is_vowel(ch) helper that checks membership in the vowel set {'a','e','i','o','u'} case-insensitively, a morse_code dictionary mapping uppercase consonant letters (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z) to their dot/dash codes, and a convert_string(s) function that iterates the input string s, skips characters for which ch.isalpha() is false, appends ch.upper() for vowels, and otherwise looks up morse_code[ch.upper()] for consonants and appends that code. The returned value is a single string with no separators between Morse symbols or letters (e.g., \"Hello, World!\" becomes \"....E.-...-..O.--O.-..-..-..\"). Complexity is linear in the input length (O(n)) and the code assumes ASCII A\u2013Z letters; to avoid KeyError on letters outside the provided mapping (such as accented or non-Latin alphabetic characters), either restrict inputs to standard English letters, check ch.upper() in morse_code before lookup, or extend the morse_code mapping. To implement this behavior reproduce the vowel check, provide the consonant\u2192Morse dictionary, iterate characters, filter non-alpha, branch on vowel vs. consonant, use case-insensitive checks and lookups as described, and return the concatenated result."}]
