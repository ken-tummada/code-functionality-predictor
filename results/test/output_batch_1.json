The class defines a JSON schema that specifies the structure and constraints for user data, requiring firstName and lastName as mandatory string fields while allowing an optional age field that must be a non-negative integer when provided. When a User object is instantiated through the constructor, it accepts firstName and lastName as required parameters and age as an optional parameter with a default value of None. The constructor automatically validates the user data against the predefined schema by converting the object to JSON format and using the jsonschema library's validate function, which will raise a validation exception if the data doesn't conform to the schema rules. The class also includes a toJson method that serializes the user object's attributes into a JSON string representation by converting the instance's dictionary of attributes using json.dumps. To implement this code, you would need to install the jsonschema library, import both jsonschema and json modules, then create User instances by passing the required name parameters and optionally an age value, with the assurance that any schema violations will be caught immediately during object creation rather than later in the application lifecycle."}, {"ref": "Create a function that takes a string and returns a new string with each vowel capitalized and each consonant converted to its corresponding Morse code. The function should ignore any special characters or numbers in the string. The returned string should only contain alphabetic characters. The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Additionally, the function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters and convert them accordingly. The function should also handle multiple consecutive special characters or numbers in the string and ignore them completely.", "cand": "This code implements a string transformation utility that converts input text into a mixed format where vowels are capitalized and consonants are replaced with their Morse code representations. The program consists of three main components: a helper function to identify vowels, a dictionary mapping consonant letters to their Morse code equivalents, and a main conversion function that processes the input string. The is_vowel function checks whether a given character is a vowel by comparing its lowercase version against a set containing the five vowels. The morse_code dictionary contains mappings for consonants only, storing their dot-dash representations as defined in International Morse Code. The convert_string function iterates through each character in the input string, skipping any non-alphabetic characters, and applies the transformation rules: if the character is a vowel, it appends the uppercase version to the result; if it's a consonant, it looks up and appends the corresponding Morse code pattern. To implement this code, simply define all three components in order, then call convert_string with any text string as the argument. For example, calling convert_string with \"Hello World\" would return \"....EO.-.....O.-.-..\" where H, L, L, W, R, L, and D are converted to Morse code while E and O appear as uppercase letters. Note that spaces and special characters are silently ignored in the output, so only alphabetic content is processed and appears in the final result."}]
