# Task
Given the code below, produce a concise technical description intended for an engineer or LLM. The description must explain the high-level purpose of the code, its intended use case, and the core technical specifications and components involved. Do not describe the code line by line. Focus on the overall design, inputs and outputs, key behaviors, and how the code should be implemented or adapted in practice. The description should be clear enough that a competent engineer could reimplement the solution based solely on your explanation.

# Output Format
