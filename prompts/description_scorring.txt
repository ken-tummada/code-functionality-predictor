# Task
Evaluate the quality of a code description using the rubric below. Analyze how well the description communicates the code's purpose, technical specifications, and implementation guidance.

# Rubric
How well does the description capture the code’s high-level intention (real-world context may be used when relevant)?
4 = The high-level intention is clearly stated, accurate, and concise.
3 = The high-level intention is mentioned but partially implicit.
2 = The high-level intention is not explicitly stated, but can be inferred.
1 = The high-level intention is missing and cannot be inferred.

How clear are the technical specifications after reading the description?
4 = Completely clear and sufficiently detailed.
3 = Mostly clear, with minor missing technical details.
2 = Partially unclear, with important technical gaps.
1 = Unclear or missing technical specifications.

At what level of abstraction does the description operate?
4 = Very high level, including business or system-level intent.
3 = High level, including core technical specifications and behavior.
2 = Low level, focused on implementation details.
1 = Very low level, focused on line-by-line code behavior.

How easily could an engineer implement the described logic, assuming sufficient technical skill?
4 = Very easy to implement without additional information.
3 = Easy to implement with minor clarification.
2 = Difficult to implement due to missing or ambiguous details.
1 = Very difficult or infeasible to implement from the description alone.
