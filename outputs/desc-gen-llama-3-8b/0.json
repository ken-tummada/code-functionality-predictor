The function is designed to handle both positive and negative integers, and it uses bitwise operations to perform the multiplication. The function takes two 32-bit integers as input, b and c, and returns a 32-bit integer result. The function uses a while loop to iterate through the bits of c, shifting the bits of b left by one position and adding the current value of b to the result if the current bit of c is set. The function also handles negative numbers by converting them to their two's complement representation before performing the multiplication. The result is then converted back to its original sign if necessary. This function is suitable for use in embedded systems or other applications where bitwise operations are necessary, and it can be adapted for use with larger integers by modifying the loop condition and the shift operations accordingly.", "\n\nThis code implements a function named `isValid` that determines whether a given string of characters represents a valid sequence of parentheses. The function takes a string of parentheses as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the string is valid. A valid string is one where every opening parenthesis has a corresponding closing parenthesis of the same type, and the closing parentheses are in the correct order. The function is intended to be used in scenarios where parentheses are used to group or nest elements in a hierarchical structure, such as in programming languages, mathematical expressions, or data formats. The function can be adapted for use in any context where parentheses are used to denote grouping or nesting, and it can be implemented using a stack data structure to keep track of the opening parentheses and their corresponding closing counterparts."]}
